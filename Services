Imagine that you have been asked to deploy web app

How does this front end web app is exposed to outside world?

How do front end web app is connected to backend database ?

How do we resolve Pod IP changed, when they die?

-------------------------------------------------------------

is it possible to have permenent IP address?

how do various components connect and communicate ?

how do applications are exposed to outside world?
---------------------------------------------------

What is a Service:  Service is a way of grouping of pods , Service is like a gatekeeper of pods


Features of Service: load balancing, Service Discovery b/w apps, features to support zero down time app deployments 


We have different Services depending on different type of containers!

consider we have front-end app and a backend-app 

front-end app is wrapped in front-end pods


back-end app is wrapped in back-end pods

therefore,

for front-end pods we will have front-end Service

for back-end pods we will have back-end Service


Once we have these services in place it groups the pods and connects them together 


Now we have setup the services...BUT!

how do these services discovered there respective pods and connect to it !? 

Answer is: through LABELS and SELECTORS 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Services:

ClusterIP Service:
	it is reachable only within a cluster 

Uses of ClusterIP Service:
		Connection b/w front-end pods and back-end pods
		typically we only expose front-end pods to the outside world
      		we do not expose back-end pods due to security reasons 


	
NodePort Service:
	there are other set of pods which we want to expose to the outside world
     	e.g: when we want to expose our web app to the outside world on internet 


LoadBalancer Service: 
	for loadbalancing amoung the pods
