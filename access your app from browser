how to access my app from which i made a docker file and created a image 
and then put that image  into pod (deployment)

you have to expose that deployment.

how to expose a deployment:

while exposing a deployment we are creating a service 

consider we have a deployment named nginx-deploy

and we want to expose it (then accessing it on browser)

for this purpose we have a command 

"
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deploy --type=LoadBalancer --port=80

"

this will expose the deployment,and a service with the same name as deployment(in this case 'nginx-deploy') will be created

to access the app we need a url for this purpose we have a simple minikube command:

"
minikube service nginx-deploy --url
"

this command will generate a url 

copy that url and paste it in your browser and you can see our app !
