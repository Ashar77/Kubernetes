we have front app and backend pods , f-pods are exposed to the outside world 
which provide access to the app

backend pods are strictly internal and are not exposed to the outside world
like db-pods they provide functionality to the f-pods whenever it is required 

to access these backend pods and connect them to the frontend pods we use service
type called CLUSTER-IP 

this makes service reachable within the cluster it is default service type
