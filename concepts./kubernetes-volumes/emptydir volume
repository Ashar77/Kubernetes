emptydir volume is first created when pod is asssigned to a node in a cluster 
stays as long as pod is running 
it is initially empty

once pod is removed in any case from a node, emptyDir is deleted forever

used for:

Temporoary space and to share some data between the multiple container within the pod 

where does emptydir directory/folder is created ? on node or in a pod? inside a pod i guess,
if on the node? then where on the node?



consider    emptyDir - Describe 



node: node on which this pod is scheduled

Mounts:
        when the pod is scheduled on node it created the temporary directory cache on that node and then mounts that directory inside the 
pod /cache , then the containers inside the pods can access this mount point " /cache " and store some temporary data inside that , so when
the pod dies or deleted from that node the directory will go off and the contents inside the directory will be complety wiped off 
this type of volume is only suitable for storing temporary data. 

on deleting the pod contents inside the /cache will be deleted if any
