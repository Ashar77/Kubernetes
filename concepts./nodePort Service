Imagine that, you have deployed your web app on to Kubernetes cluster

Now, you to need to expose it to outside world on the internet  


suppose we have an app inside a pod , user will access this app
but we can not trust the PodIP because they are affimiral and also there is no connectivity
between the user and the service  the solution to both these problems is nodePort Service


NodePort: the port on the Node where the pod is running 

Nodeport services exposes the app on node where ever the pod is deployed 

nodeport = [3000-32767]

the user will access the app by:

	https://nodeIP:nodePort ----> user can access the app using browser 


nodeIP --> gcloud .. external ip 



TargetPort: the port where actual app is running


curl http:// podIP:targetport           

curl http:// ServiceIP:targetport








Downsides of NodePort 

you can only have one Service per port

you can only use ports 3000-32767

if your Node/VM IP address change, you need to deal with that 


this service is good for demo app or test app or something which is temporary or 
when you have to be cost efficient
