Deployments ----> Updates and Rollbacks and scaling

we manage all the pods and repicasets just by a single doployment manifest file


features of deployments:

Multiple Replicas

Updrade

Rollback

Scale up or down

Pause and Resume	??????????

------------------------

Deployment Types:

	shifting from A to B


Recreate:
	shutting down A ,maker sure A is OFF, Deploy B (there will be a downtime in this type of deployment)


RollingUpdate(Ramped or Incremental):
				it will slowly update by replacing app instances one after the another
				it is a default strategy in kubernetes but it can take some time.




Canary:  
   
    gradually shifting production traffic from A version to B.
	(when you donot update all the instances)
(ideal version for one who want to test the new version)


Blue/Green Update:
	green B is deployed along side the version A which is Blue with exactly same number of instances
	

do we change the image in container while updating in a deployment ?
