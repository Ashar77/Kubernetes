after successful creation of deployment 
when i check the staus of pod, it was showing
'image pull backoff' and after few minutes 
many of the pods were running and after a small delay all of the pods were running, was this due to 
healthcheck in pods or "image pull backoff" gets 
eliminated itself after few minutes
