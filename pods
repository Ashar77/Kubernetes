in virtualization basic scheduling unit is Virtual Machine (VM)

in Containerization basic scheduling unit is Container

in Kubernetes basic scheduling unit are pods

pod deployment 

multi-container pod 

pod networking 

Inter-pod networking and Intra-pod networking

pod manifest file

The concept of scheduling in cloud computing refers to  allocating VMs to run on the available resources in order to fulfill users'demands

In kubernetes we do not interact with containers directly,containers are inside the pods 
we scale up and scale down the pods a/c to the traffic. 

Normally we have one container per pod but we can also have 2 or more dependent containers together in a pod 

Once we deployed a pod inside a kubernetes cluster it will get its own IP adress 

2 or more containers in a pod have the same IP adress the only distiguishing thing between them
is "Ports"  

Containers in the same pod not only share same IP address they also share same volume,same c-group
limits and even same IPC names 


Inter-pod communication ---> communication between 2 pods

intra-pod communication ----> communication within a pod

containers within a pod communicate using a shared "local-host"
