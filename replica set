It ensures that a specified number of pods are running at any time


Replica set and pods are associated with 'labels'


Replica set ---> set-based Selectors + Equality-based Selectors

Replication controller ---> only Equality-based Selectors



in manifest file of r-s in selector section:

give matchlabels in case of: ReplicaSet,Deployments,Jobs,DaemonSet (new resources) 

do not give match labels in case of : Replicationcontrollers , services (old resources)



----------------------------------------
ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pods are running at any time

if we have created 3 replicas of a pod in a replica set, rs will make sure that we always have
those three pods up and running on our cluster, if any of the pods show any kind of error
it will remove it and create another pod so the number of pods will always remain 3 
if any node is unhealty it will create another pod on any other healthy node and the pod on that 
unhealthy node will have the status 'unknown' and after sometime that pod on that unhealthy node 
will be off.
