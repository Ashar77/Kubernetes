stateless app = app which donot store any data

k8s volumes are better then docker volumes

at its core volume is just a directory which may have some data in it, and is accessible by the container 

2 categories of volumes are efemeral and durable

efemeral --> created when pod is created , die when pod is die

durable ---> created when pod is created , data inside is persisted even after pod is dead 


there are around 30 types of volume supported in kubernetes.
